Coding framework

Phase 1
Create main code to interact with alpaca and implement base strategy

    Base strategy
    Read a list of symbols to do analysis on
    Perform analysis on each symbol
    From analysis determine which stocks might need to be boough or sold
    Actually perform the order
        Buy order will wait until RSI crossover above oversold than will wait 
        for macd crossover of fast above slow to issue a limit order set at the macd crossover with the buy there will be a stop loss which is minus 3 percent change in price and a profit target of 5 percent or when rsi crosses under overbought and macd crossover of fast below slow



Phase 2
Develop or interface with a stock screener to choose which stocks to watch and 
try and implement strategy
Add to strategy of trailing stop loss as another method
